# Transformation of *E. coli*

Estimated time required to complete: 3h + overnight incubation.

## Materials

- Chimiocompetent *E. coli* strain (50 - 100 µL)
- Plasmid of interest (10 - 200 ng/µL)
- 2-mercaptoethanol (1 - 5 M)
- Ice
- Sterile and cold (-20 °C) 10 µL pipette tips
- Thermostated bath
- SOC medium (250 µL per bacteria aliquot)
- Shaking incubator for eppendorf tubes
- Stove
- Laminar flow hood or bunsen burner
- LB agar petri dishes with appropriate antibiotic already incorporated

## Protocol

**Always proceed under sterile conditions (ideally under laminar flow hood) when
  opening LB agar petri dishes or tubes containing bacteria or SOC medium.**

1. Gently thaw bacteria aliquot **on ice**
2. Add 2-mercaptoethanol qsp 25 mM final concentration (in a volume of max 1 µL
   to avoid over dilution of the solution that keeps bacteria competent)
3. Incubate **on ice** 10 min
4. Add plasmid of interest: 0.5 - 1 µL (a few tens of ng is usually sufficient,
   more will increase number of recombinant clones)
5. Incubate **on ice** at least 30 min (longer incubation times do not harm)
6. Apply thermal shock: strictly 45 s at 42 °C (for standard 1.5 mL eppendorf
   tubes, may require adjustment for other types of tubes depending how well
   they allow heat transfers)
7. Incubate **on ice** at least 2 min (longer incubation times do not harm)
8. Add 250 µL SOC medium (room tempetature is ok at this stage)
9. Incubate at 37 °C under agitation (800 - 900 rpm) at least 1h (up to 2h)
10. Spread bacteria on LB agar petri dishes: 20 µL and 200 µL (to ensure a
    sufficient number of well isolated colonies in case of high or low
    transformation efficiency)
11. Incubate overnight at 37 °C in a stove

Colonies may be used up to 1 week after transformation if petri dishes are
stored at 4 °C.
